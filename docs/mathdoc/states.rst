Film State
==========
In order to calculate thermophysical properties of the vapor mixture film, its
state must be specified. The `chamber` package uses a python dictionary to
with three keys  to represent the film state. The keys are `P`, `T`, and `x1`
which represent the pressure [Pa], temperature [K], andwater mole fraction.
